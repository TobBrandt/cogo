COGO is a continous version of the game GO.
Instead of putting pieces on the intersections of a grid, pieces can move around freely.
A piece is considered captured if it cannot move in any direction by at least a piece diameter without colliding with another piece.
Note that this, opposed to traditional GO, makes friendly fire possible.

Dependencies other than the Haskell platform:
  wx
  bool-extras
  simple-observer
  utility-ht

Compiling and running:
  $ make
  $ build/cogo &
